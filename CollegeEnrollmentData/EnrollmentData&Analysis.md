# College Enrollment per Income Group vs. Various Factors

We are investigating the relationship between the various income groups' college enrollment percentage and certain statistics related to economic data. We want to see what economic factors have the greatest effect on college enrollment rates.

## Part 1: College Prices vs Wages

First we will look at the rising college prices, and the rate they are increasing. This price includes tuition and r&b.

Around the year 2000, the growth rate of college prices has sudden growth, going from nearly +$200 per year to +$400 per year.


College Prices are definitely at an high rate. Now we want to see if wages are able to grow along the same rate. The next chart will look at each income classes wages and how they compare to these college prices.

This chart showcases the severity that college prices are beginning to increase. This rate is so high, that in 2001 the price of college has began to exceed the mean income for the bottom 20% of income in this country.

## Part 2: Enrollment Rates and Perdicted Values

Next we will look at each income levels college enrollment rate. We want to see the perdicted values for each of the enrollment rates using linear regression.

First we are looking at each income levels enrollment rate, this is depicted by pecent of the class enrolled in college.

To know surprise, the more money one has the higher chance one has to go to college. The intesting thing about this is the sudden rapid increase of low income college students since 2013. In 2015, low income students had a better chance to get into college than middle income for the first time.

The previous data makes low and mid incomes far more interesting to study. So the following data is going to show their perdicted values using linear regression. This will point out the more interesting years for us to look into further.
