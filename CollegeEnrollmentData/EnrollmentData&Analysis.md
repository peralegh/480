# College Enrollment per Income Group vs. Economic Factors

We are investigating the relationship between the various income groups' college enrollment percentage and certain statistics related to economic data. We want to see what economic factors have the greatest effect on college enrollment rates.

We used linear regression as our model, since we wanted to see mostly change over time. Year was always our X axis, our Y axis changed depending on the variable we wanted to see change.

## Part 1: College Prices vs Wages

First we will look at the rising college prices, and the rate they are increasing. This price includes tuition and r&b.

Around the year 2000, the growth rate of college prices has sudden growth, going from nearly +$200 per year to +$400 per year.


College Prices are definitely at an high rate. Now we want to see if wages are able to grow along the same rate. The next chart will look at each income classes wages and how they compare to these college prices.

This chart showcases the severity that college prices are beginning to increase. This rate is so high, that in 2001 the price of college has began to exceed the mean income for the bottom 20% of income in this country.

## Part 2: Enrollment Rates and Perdicted Values

Next we will look at each income levels college enrollment rate. We want to see the predicted values for each of the enrollment rates using linear regression.

First we are looking at each income levels enrollment rate, this is depicted by pecent of the class enrolled in college.

To now surprise, the more money one has the higher chance one has to go to college. The intesting thing about this is the sudden rapid increase of low income college students since 2013. In 2015, low income students had a better chance to get into college than middle income for the first time.

The previous data makes low and mid incomes far more interesting to study. So the following data is going to show their predicted values using linear regression. This will point out the more interesting years for us to look into further.

Here we have the low income enrollment by year with predicted values.

Low Income enrollment is very volitile, and from a glance it is difficult to determine if college price has any correlation with it.

Here we have the mid income enrollment by year with predicted values.

This shows that the best relitve attendance of college for mid income students happened right before 2000 as the actual values were far above the predicted ones. This shows that the increase of college prices most likely had an effect on middle class enrollment.

## Part 3: Looking at How General Economic Change Can Effect Enrollment 

### Recessions
We wanted to look at how the current state of the economy effects each income levels enrollment rate.

The first chart is a plot of enrollment rate at each income. The difference is we are highlighting when a recession is occouring so we can view how the enrollment rate changes during that period.

![alt_text](https://github.com/peralegh/480/blob/master/CollegeEnrollmentData/enrollWrecession.png "Percent Enrollment at Each Income Level With Recession")

Low and mid income mostly have consitancy, dropping whenever there is a recession. High income is interesting, as they have large increses in enrollment percent during these periods. This is likely due to recessions hitting middle and lower classes harder, and high income student being far more likely to be able to afford college.

Here we have the low income enrollment with recession by year & the predicted values.

![alt_text](https://github.com/peralegh/480/blob/master/CollegeEnrollmentData/LowEnrollmentRecession.png "Percent Enrollment of Low Income with Predictions and Recession Data")

Again, low income enrollment has very little correlation with the data we have chosen to use. It is difficult to see why low income enrollment rate changes the way it does.

Here we have the mid income enrollment with recession by year & the predicted values.

![alt_text](https://github.com/peralegh/480/blob/master/CollegeEnrollmentData/MidEnrollmentRecession.png "Percent Enrollment of Middle Income with Predictions and Recession Data")

Middle Income predicted values seem to be heavily influenced by recession data. The only significant drops in the predicted values happen in on the recession years.

## Part 4: Conclusion

From the data collected we have concluded that the middle class enrollment is the most effected by the changes in the economy. Whether it is changes in college prices or the state of overall economy there appeared to be some correlation between it and middle class enrollment. Lower class enrollment appears to have other factors that have a greater effect on it, and the upper class thrives when the other classes are struggling.

We could have improved our research if we could have obtained individual student data for more accurate predictions on enrollment. Also we could have seen how much each student at certain income levels relied on student loans as well.
